              Earning points to buy your first piece of second-hand furniture is
              a great way to encourage sustainable habits while also saving
              money. <br />
              By participating in programs that reward users for buying or
              selling second-hand furniture. <br /> This creates a cycle of
              reuse that benefits both the environment and your wallet. <br />{" "}
